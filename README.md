Plan

use https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/GUIandEventDrivenProgramming/01_intro_gui.html as a nice huide

1) Using scratch paper, physically draw a rough sketch of your user interface.

2) Create the basic structure of your program and create the major frames that will hold the widgets needed for your programâ€™s interface. Give the frames an initial size and color so that you can visually see them, given that there are no widgets inside of them to determine their size.

3) Incrementally add all of the widgets you need for your program and size and position them appropriately.

4) Create your callback functions, stub them out, and assign them to appropriate events. Verify that the events are executing the correct functions.

5) Incrementally implement the functionality needed for each callback function.
